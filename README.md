### Overview

This is my first project completed for the Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp with General Assembly. It took around 3.5 days to finish and was a huge learning experience. Taking all the things I've learnt over the past two weeks and implementing it into this project was challenging but also very fun. Creating a game using multiple functions, debugging, testing different scenarios and utilising CSS were just some of the things I had to do in order for everything to come together. I struggled at times with the logic of using node elements and combining that with functions to implement rules but with some guidance I was able to work through these issues.
